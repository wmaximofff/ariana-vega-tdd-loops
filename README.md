# TDD Loops

This problem set is all about loops!

## Instructions

Complete each function in `index.js` according to the JSDoc.

Run `npm test` in your terminal to test your code. Try to pass all test cases!

> [!WARNING]
>
> The JSDoc examples are not comprehensive. Try to think about edge cases
> as you write your code; otherwise, you might get stuck in an infinite loop!
> You can press `q` to exit out of `vitest` if you do get stuck.
